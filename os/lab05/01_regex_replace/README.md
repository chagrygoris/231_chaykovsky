# Regex Replace

## üìù –£—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–µ

Write a program that inputs three command-line arguments:

- `argv[1]` &ndash; regular expression;
- `argv[2]` &ndash; text;
- `argv[3]` &ndash; replacement.

The program finds all occurrences of the regular expression in the text and replaces all of them with the specified replacement string. The updated text is stored in a separate buffer and printed to the console in the end.

> üí° Algorithm is as follows. Allocate a buffer for the new text. Find a regular expression match. Copy to the buffer text before match. Copy to the buffer replacement. Find the next regular expression match and so on.

- The problem when the size of the allocated buffer is not enough to store the text can be solved by using the `realloc` function to allocated additional space.
